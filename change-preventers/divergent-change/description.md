Divergent Change
================

Divergent Change resembles Shotgun Surgery but is actually the opposite smell. Divergent Change is when many changes are made to a single class. Shotgun Surgery refers to when a single change is made to multiple classes simultaneously.

Signs and Symptoms
------------------

You find yourself having to change many unrelated methods when you make changes to a class. For example, when adding a new product type you have to change the methods for finding, displaying, and ordering products.

Reasons for the Problem
-----------------------

Often these divergent modifications are due to poor program structure or "copypasta programming‚Äù.

Treatment
---------

- Split up the behavior of the class via Extract Class.
- If different classes have the same behavior, you may want to combine the classes through inheritance (Extract Superclass and Extract Subclass).

Payoff
------

- Improves code organization.
- Reduces code duplication.
- Simplifies support.
