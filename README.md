This is a project all about putting the information you need right at your fingertips.

You download this repo and add an alias for codesmells=<path-to-source>/codesmells.sh and off you go!

Now you have a cheat sheet for many code smells right at your fingertips. No internet required!

I am sourcing all of my information from https://sourcemaking.com/refactoring - the information there is richer so go ahead and check it out. Command line does have limitations after all ;)
